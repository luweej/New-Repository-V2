# Goal

Knowing what factors determine a person's income is crucial for making informed career and financial decisions. Our project is using data science to predict what factors lead to individuals earning at least $50k a year, based on their attributes. By analyzing a large dataset of demographic and employment information, we're uncovering patterns and relationships that were previously hidden. Let's use data to empower individuals and drive economic success.

<br>

Our goal can be accomplished through exploring these questions:

* How does education impact the achievement of a $50K salary?

* How does occupation impact $50K salary achievement?

* What are the best target markets to find the most appropriate candidates for our program?
